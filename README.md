## Building configuration 
* **OS Supported :** Windows, Linux

### Clone repository 
In the local folder for the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LibertAntoine/Minecraft_editor.git
```

### Linux

#### Add dependencies 
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake libgl1-mesa-dev  libsdl2-dev libeigen3-dev libglew-dev.
```

#### Build
In the project folder
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Execute
In the project folder
```bash
bin/Minecraft
```

### Windows
* Move SDL2.dll from WinDependencies\SDL2\{systemType} to the bin directory
* Move SDL2.dll from WinDependencies\glew-2.1.0\{configType}\{systemType} to the bin directory
* Open Visual studio project and generate the project.


## Presentation
<p>
Cubic-based 3D world editor, developed in C++ and the OpenGL 4 graphics API. This editor offers a very complete interface allowing you to create cubes by moving a selector or using the mouse. It is possible to change the colour or texture of the cubes, and to do multi-texturing on the same cube, by choosing a different texture per face. It is possible to place a directional or point light in the scene. Each cube is built by the geometry shader from a coordinate. The cubes are rendered in batch rendering technics.
</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from a lecture about image synthesis and applied mathematics at the IMAC engineering school.
</p>

Realized in December 2019.
